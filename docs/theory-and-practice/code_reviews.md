# Code Reviews
## What is a code review?
A code review is people looking at a proposed code change from someone and making comments on it. Typically the requester and reviewers are engineers, but that is not required.

## What is a pull request (PR)?
A pull request is GitHub's mechanism for publishing proposed code changes to allow for review comments.

## What are the benefits?
* Verification of correctness
* Knowledge sharing
  * Code
  * Domain
  * Bi-directional
* Security check
* Style check
* Design check
* Algorithm check
* Testing check

## What are the challenges?
* Time
   * Delay in release
   * Time for reviewers to read and comment
   * Time to make recommended changes
* Selection of reviewers
* Sizing

## What makes a good review request?
* Atomic changes
* Good commit comments
* Supporting documents
  * Product spec (link)
  * Screenshots
  * Timing information
  * Test cases
* Concise description of change
  * What?
  * Why?
  * Who?
* Timing
  * Provide sufficient time
  * Communicate urgency
* Reviewer selection
  * No rubber-stamping

## What makes a good review?
* Be polite!
  * Take serious disagreements offline
  * We're a team
* Be thorough
  * Is code complete?
  * Is code correct?
  * Is code readable?
* Reject poor requests
* Be familiar with style requirements
* DRY
* Ask questions
  * Again, it's about communication as much as verification
