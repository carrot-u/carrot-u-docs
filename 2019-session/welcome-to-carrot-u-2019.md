# Welcome To Carrot U

Welcome **Carrot U Class of 2019**!

Over the next 6 months (or so) you'll learn what you need to get started as a software engineer. We'll cover things like SQL, Ruby, Javascript, Ruby on Rails, React, computer science theory, and practical skills to just make you a better engineer.

Throughout this course you will be supported by current Instacart engineers who will act as mentors as well as your fellow students.

Each week, you will have video lectures to watch, assignments to complete, and a live lecture held in the Instacart office.

**Keep up with the work!**

Everything builds on top of other concepts. Ask questions when you don't know things. Recognize that sometimes you will struggle and that's ok.
