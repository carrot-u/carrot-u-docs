# Plan

- what is big-o anyways
- basic data structures - array, hash (set)
- queue and stack
- example 1
- advanced data structures - trees, weird tries
- intro to dynamic programing
- example 2

---

# Big O

- it is metric
- it is simplified
- it is asymptomatic 
- how many times we need to do something

---

# Big O

It is actually two metrics

- big-O of time
- big-O of space 
- we care about both
- we look at data structures keeping big-O in mind

---
# Big O

- we talk about O(n) , where n is number of "things"
- we say O(n) = O(1) (read as - algorithm is of constant e.g. time)

# Typical O(n) with names

- O(1) - constant (best, rarely achievable)
- O(log n) - logarithmic (what you strive for)
- O(n) - linear (very good)
- O(n^2) - quadratic or n squared
- O(n^3) - cubic
- O(e^n) - exponential (terrible)

---

# Basic Data Structures
# Array 

Just list of things

```ruby
array = [1,2,3] 
array.first
array[2]
```

---
# Basic Data Structures
# Array
### Good for?
- sequential access
- random access by index

### OK for 
- adding elements to the end

### Bad for 
- adding elements to the head

---

# Basic Data Structures
# Array
## big-o

- O(1) random access by index
- O(n) lookup by value
- O(n) space

---

# Basic Data Structures
# Hash 

map of things (called key) related to other things (called values)

```ruby
hash = { a: 1, b: 2 }
hash[:a] # 1
```

---
# Basic Data Structures
# Hash
## Good for?
- random access by key
- adding new items

---

# Basic Data Structures
# Hash
## big-o

- O(1) random access by key
- O(n) space

---

# Basic Data Structures
# Queue

FIFO - first in first out

```ruby
queue = Queue.new
queue.push(2) # add 
queue.peek()  # peek at value
queue.pop()   # take and remove value from the end k
queue.pop()   # nil
```
---

# Basic Data Structures
# Queue
## big-o

- O(1) reading/removing from tail
- O(1) adding to head
- O(n) space
---

# Basic Data Structures
# Stack

FILO - first in last out

```ruby
stack = Stack.new
stack.push(2) # add 
stack.peek()  # peek at value
stack.pop()   # take and remove value from the end k
stack.pop() # nil
```
---

# Basic Data Structures
# Stack
## big-o

- O(1) reading/removing from head
- O(1) adding to head
- O(n) space

---

# Example 1

Check that expression has balanced pairs of parenthises

- `(  )` balanced
- `(  1 + 1 )` balanced
- `( 1 + 1 ` not balanced
- `[ 1 + ( 2 + 3 ) ]` balanced

---

# Advanced Data Structures
# Trees
- O(log n) lookup
- O(2*log n) add/remove

![Tree](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Binary_tree.svg/384px-Binary_tree.svg.png)

---
# what are weird tries

- binary trees
- balanced binary trees
- red/black tree
- avl tree
- heap
---

# Dynamic programming
  
- break into sub problems
- figure out solution to sub problem
- choose best solution across all sub problems
- (*) optimize - calculate sub problems only once


Memoisation - storing solutions for subproblems

---

# Example 2 - giving change

- given type of coins available, calculate change
- given 1, 5 cent coins calculate change to 95 cents 
 

---

# Home work

- finish giving-change problem
- can we implement stack with a queue? 
- what about queue with a stack?
